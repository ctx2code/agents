# Agent Rules

## Keep Task Summary Within Version Control

- Try to read from `docs/ctx.md` for a summary of what previous commit did.
- When it's done and all feedbacks positive, write a summary of the task.
  - The summary should be saved into `docs/ctx.md`.
    - If `docs/ctx.md` doesn't change since last commit, overwrite it.
    - If `docs/ctx.md` is modified, append the summary to it's end.
    
## Writing the Summary

- The summary should not contain what code, comments or docs already says.
- The summary should systematically summarizes what the user demands.
- The summary should also explain failed approaches.
- Refer to local or online documents when explaining unfamiliar things.
